## A section about some stuff


The [cumulative distribution function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution#Cumulative_distribution_function) can be expressed as:

$$F(k;n,p) = \Pr(X \le k) = \sum_{i=0}^{\lfloor k \rfloor} {n\choose i}p^i(1-p)^{n-i}$$

### Subsection 

Note on space:

Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction.

PMF 

$$f(k,n,p) = \Pr(k;n,p) = \Pr(X = k) = \binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$$

I want to add lots and lots of text here and it is going to be funt to resolve this merge conflict. 

The binomial distribution is frequently used to model the number of successes in a sample of size n drawn with replacement from a population of size N. If the sampling is carried out without replacement, the draws are not independent and so the resulting distribution is a hypergeometric distribution, not a binomial one. However, for N much larger than n, the binomial distribution remains a good approximation, and is widely used.

$$F(k;n,p) = \Pr(X \le k) = \sum_{i=0}^{\lfloor k \rfloor} {n\choose i}p^i(1-p)^{n-i}$$
